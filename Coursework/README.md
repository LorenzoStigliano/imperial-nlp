# NLP Coursework 2023
  
## Project repository

This repository should contain your project code (an uploaded .ipynb file is fine), your dev set predictions and your test set predictions.

## Creating your prediction files

Your dev set and test set predictions need to be named dev.txt and test.txt (see the examples provided). You should submit the predictions from your top performing model.

As described in the coursework specification document, you will be required to submit a SHA1 key corresponding to the commit that you want to be submitted.
